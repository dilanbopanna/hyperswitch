## Join us in building HyperSwitch

### Our Belief

> Payments should be open, fast, reliable and affordable to serve
> the billions of people at scale.

<!--
HyperSwitch would allow everyone to quickly customize and set up an open payment
switch, while giving a unified experience to your users, abstracting away the
ever shifting payments landscape.

The HyperSwitch journey starts with a payment orchestrator.
It was born from our struggle to understand and integrate various payment
options/payment processors/networks and banks, with varying degrees of
documentation and inconsistent API semantics. -->

Globally payment diversity has been growing at a rapid pace.
There are hundreds of payment processors and new payment methods like BNPL,
RTP etc.
Businesses need to embrace this diversity to increase conversion, reduce cost
and improve control.
But integrating and maintaining multiple processors needs a lot of dev effort.
Why should devs across companies repeat the same work?
Why can't it be unified and reused? Hence, HyperSwitch was born to create that
reusable core and let companies build and customize on top of it.

### Our Values

1. Embrace Payments Diversity: It will drive innovation in the ecosystem in
   multiple ways.
2. Make it Open Source: Increases trust; Improves the quality and reusability of
   software.
3. Be Community driven: It enables participatory design and development.
4. Build it like Systems Software: This sets a high bar for Reliability,
   Security and Performance SLAs.
5. Maximize Value Creation: For developers, customers & partners.

### Contributing

This project is being created and maintained by [Juspay](https://juspay.in),
South Asia's largest payments orchestrator/switch, processing more than 50
Million transactions per day. The solution has 1Mn+ lines of Haskell code built
over 10 years.
HyperSwitch leverages our experience in building large-scale, enterprise-grade &
frictionless payment solutions.
It is built afresh for the global markets as an open-source product in Rust.
We are long-term committed to building and making it useful for the community.

The product roadmap is open for the community's feedback.
We shall evolve a prioritization process that is open and community-driven.
We welcome contributions from the community. Please read through our
[contributing guidelines](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Included are directions for opening issues, coding standards, and notes on
development.

Important note for Rust developers: We aim for contributions from the community
across a broad range of tracks. Hence, we have prioritized simplicity and code
readability over purely idiomatic code. For example, some of the code in core
functions (e.g., `payments_core`) is written to be more readable than
pure-idiomatic.
